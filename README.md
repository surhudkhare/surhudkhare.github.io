# Welcome to MyPy
Thank you for visiting the page and looking at my experiments in python 
Currently I am focusing on the following topics:
1. Exploratory data analysis
  1. Data cleaning
  2. Data type conversions
  3. Visualization
2. Machine learning
  1. Solving ML problems using various algorithms
  2. Comparing model performances
  3. Model evaluation metrics visualization
  
## Python conferences - PyData, SciPy, PyCon
Following along the sessions conducted at various Python conferences can be a great source of gaining hands-on experience with many of the python libraries and leveraging their capabilities in personal projects

### SciPy2017: Machine Learning - scikit-learn
