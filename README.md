# Welcome to MyPy
Thank you for visiting the page and looking at my experiments in python: EDA, visualization and machine learning projects
## Python conferences - PyData, SciPy, PyCon
Following along the sessions conducted at various Python conferences can be a great source of gaining hands-on experience with many of the python libraries and leveraging their capabilities in personal projects

### SciPy2017: Machine Learning - scikit-learn
